# Milestone Project 2
## Description
---
This is my second milestone project on the Full Stack Developer course by Code Institute. The aim is to create a responsive mobile first appraoch dashboard, which contains several dynamic charts, to visualise various dimensiions of a chosen dataset.

I chose to use a dataset based on global shark attacks as this is something that I find interesting. This is purely a front-end project so no manipulation of the data has taken place on the back-end. This is purely a visualisation of data that is already in the file.

## UX
---

### User Stories
* I want to be able to view the number of Shark Attacks by country (top ten)
* I want to be able to view the number of Shark Attacks by Year
* I want to be able to filter by state for the Shark Attacks in Australia and the USA

### Wireframes



## Features
---
#### Current Features
The current features of this dashboard include multiple interactive charts. By clicking on any value in any of the charts, all other charts
will filter accordingly.

#### Future Features
Future features will depends on the data available. I would like to add a chart to show attacks by species. The data in the species column of this
dataset was not complete.



## Technologies/Support Used
---
Below is a list of technolgies I used to build my dahsboard.
* HTML - HTML5 provided the structure of my website. I tried to use semantic elements where possible to ensure the best structure.
* CSS - Used to style my page.
* [Bootstrap]() - Used primarily for the grid system. I find this a really good way to position my elements where I want them.
* [VSCode]() - This is my text editor. It has a built in terminal so I could do everything I needed to from one environment.
* [Git]() - Git was used for version control. Allowing me to create backups whenever significant changes were made to my code.
* [GitHub]() - This is where my repository is held externally. I will aslo use GitHub pages to deploy my website.
* [Javascript/Jquery]() - 
* [d3.js]()
* [crossfilter.js]()
* [dc.js]()
* [Google Fonts]() - Used to import specific fonts I wanted to use on my website.

## Deployment
---
My website was created using VSCode. VSCode is a text editor with a built in terminal. I chose to use a text editor/IDE outside of AWS Cloud9 to gain experience working outside of a browser. Once I had created my file strcuture and first HTML page, i initiated a local repository using GIT which was downloaded onto my machine previously. I then created an external repository in GitHub and linked the local and external repositories. This allowed me to version control throughout the lifespan of the development.

* I created a new environment in VS Code
* In the bash terminal, entered 'git init'
* Created all my folders and files.
* Entered 'git add .' into the bash terminal
* Entered 'git commit' into the bash terminal and created my initial commit
* I then linked my local git repository to a GitHub repository.
* I then followed the below steps to deploy the site to GitHub pages.

To deploy the website to GitHub pages, I followed the below steps:
* Selected the milestone-project-1 from my GitHub dashboard.
* Selected 'Settings' from the menu bar.
* From the GitHub pages section, I chose 'master branch' from the dropdown menu.
* Once selected, the page refreshed and a link was displayed in the GitHub pages section to my wesbite.
