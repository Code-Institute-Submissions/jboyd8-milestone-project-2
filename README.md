# Milestone Project 1
## Description
---
This is my second milestone project on the Full Stack Developer course by Code Institute. The aim is to create a responsive mobile first appraoch dashboard, which contains several dynamic charts, to visualise various dimensiions of a chosen dataset.

I chose to use a dataset based on global shark attacks as this is something that I find interesting. This is purely a front-end project so no manipulation of the data has taken place on the back-end. This is purely a visualisation of data that is already in the file.


## UX
---

### User Stories
* I want to be able to view the number of Shark Attacks by country (top ten)
* I want to be able to view the number of Shark Attacks by Year
* I want to be able to filter by state for the Shark Attacks in Australia and the USA

## Technologies/Support Used

Below is a list of technolgies I used to build my dahsboard.
* HTML - HTML5 provided the structure of my website. I tried to use semantic elements where possible to ensure the best structure.
* CSS was used to style my page.

## Deployment
---
My website was created using VSCode. VSCode is a text editor with a built in terminal. I chose to use a text editor/IDE outside of AWS Cloud9 to gain experience working outside of a browser. Once I had created my file strcuture and first HTML page, i initiated a local repository using GIT which was downloaded onto my machine previously. I then created an external repository in GitHub and linked the local and external repositories. This allowed me to version control throughout the lifespan of the development.

* I created a new environment in VS Code
* In the bash terminal, entered 'git init'
* Created all my folders and files.
* Entered 'git add .' into the bash terminal
* Entered 'git commit' into the bash terminal and created my initial commit
* I then linked my local git repository to a GitHub repository.
* I then followed the below steps to deploy the site to GitHub pages.

To deploy the website to GitHub pages, I followed the below steps:
* Selected the milestone-project-1 from my GitHub dashboard.
* Selected 'Settings' from the menu bar.
* From the GitHub pages section, I chose 'master branch' from the dropdown menu.
* Once selected, the page refreshed and a link was displayed in the GitHub pages section to my wesbite.
